This work was done by :
[Me](https://github.com/Nader-Khalil) ,[Yassmina Abdo](https://github.com/yassmina-abdo) and [Maryam Mostafa](https://github.com/Maryam-Mostafa)


I'd like to cite: https://github.com/tychovdo/PacmanDQN His implementation in Tensorflow helped me configure the Neural Network architecture.
